SDG 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. It covers maternal and child health, communicable and non-communicable diseases, mental health, and access to quality healthcare.

Globally, over 5 million children under age 5 died in 2019, mostly from preventable causes. SDG 3 targets include reducing neonatal mortality to at least 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to 25 per 1,000 live births.

One of SDG 3's primary targets is to achieve universal health coverage (UHC), including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services, and safe, effective, affordable medicines and vaccines for all.

India’s Ayushman Bharat Yojana is the world’s largest health assurance scheme, providing ₹5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization to over 10 crore families.

The Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) is a government scheme that provides financial assistance to promote institutional deliveries among poor pregnant women.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes, cancer, and heart disease are leading causes of death. SDG 3 aims to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one-third through prevention and treatment.

Vaccination plays a key role in achieving SDG 3. India’s Mission Indradhanush provides free immunization against 12 preventable diseases including polio, tetanus, and measles.

Mental health is often overlooked. SDG 3 promotes strengthening the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol.

Air pollution, unsafe water, and poor sanitation are major health risks. SDG 3 includes reducing deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and environmental pollution.

Good health and well-being are essential for sustainable development. Poor health increases poverty, reduces productivity, and limits access to education and work.

Reducing maternal mortality is a major SDG 3 target. The goal is to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births.

Adolescent health is key to breaking the cycle of poverty. Education on sexual health, access to contraception, and menstrual hygiene is vital for empowering youth and reducing teenage pregnancies.

Road traffic injuries are a significant public health issue. SDG 3 aims to halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents by 2030.

Health workforce shortages and weak health systems are barriers to SDG 3. Investing in health infrastructure and training is essential to deliver quality care for all.

Tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases remain challenges. SDG 3 targets ending these epidemics through early detection, treatment, and vaccination efforts.

Access to affordable medicines is critical. SDG 3 calls for supporting R&D of vaccines and medicines, particularly for diseases that primarily affect developing countries.
